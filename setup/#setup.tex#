\section{EASIER}
The  EASIER experiment  is one  of the  three C-band  (3.4 -  4.2 GHz)
experiments  deployed in  the  Pierre Auger  Observatory site  besides
AMBER~\cite{gorham} and MIDAS~\cite{midas}. The latter detectors share
the concept of radio-fluorescence detectors, instrumenting an array of
feed  horn antennas  at the  focus of  a parabolic  dish. Just  as the
fluorescence   detectors,  they  aim   at  imaging   the  longitudinal
development  of the  showers. EASIER  is  an alternative  design ;  as
individual  antennas are  embedded  in the  surface  detectors of  the
Pierre Auger Observatory. The concept relies on the observation of the
shower  from the  ground with  a wide  angle antenna  pointing  to the
zenith.  While  EASIER-61  is  successfully running  since  2011,  new
estimations of the expected intensity  led us to implement a new array
with an enhanced sensitivity. Both of the arrays are presented in this
section.
 
\subsection {The noise environment in the Pierre Auger Observatory site}
Prior to  the installation, measurements  of the surrounding  noise in
the C-band  revealed no  transient or steady  noise source  that could
pollute the antennas receptivity to  a radio emission in the microwave
band.  The noise  spectrum measured  with  a C-band  antenna in  Pampa
Amarilla is  shown in figure~\ref{fig:Pampa_spec}.  No transient noise
was found in the frequency band of interest (3.4- 4.2 GHz).

\subsection{The experimental setup}  
The  Pierre Auger  Observatory surface  detector is  composed  of 1660
local stations arranged  in a tringular grid of  1500m spacement. Each
local station is a water  Cherenkov detector equipped with three PMTs,
a       local        acquisition       and       a       communication
system~\cite{augerdetector}. An EASIER detector unit is designed to be
integrated  into the  SD station  and  measure the  emission from  air
shower in the microwave frequency range.  \\ The radio detector itself
is composed of an antenna  and an amplification system, it is combined
with an adaptation electronics to convert the RF signal into a voltage
proportional to  the RF power envelope  as shown on  the schematics on
the fig.~\ref{fig:diagram}.  It is then  adapted to fit into the local
station front end electronics since EASIER signal replace one low gain
channel of  one PMT  (each local station  acquires ordinarly  the last
dynode and the anode of three  PMTs, the anode being used only in case
of saturation of the dynode).   As a consequence, no separated trigger
for the radio signal is needed, the EASIER data are simply part of the
regular SD data stream.  As  an additional benefit, the radio detector
is  powered by the  station battery  and is  also integrated  into the
SD station's monitoring  system.

%% MBR is emitted by the  low energy ionization electrons
%% and its intensity depends on the deposited energy by the shower front,
%% thus the expected  radio signal time profile would  contain the shower
%% development    information    as    represented   schmematically    on
%% fig.~\ref{fig:expectedsignal}.
%% The  radio   waveform  is  recorded   together  with  the   usual  PMT
%% information, that  is to say whenever  a coincidence on  PMT signal of
%% three adjacent SD stations  is established.  EASIER takes advantage of
%% the  facilities of  Auger  surface detector  in  particular the  power
%% supply  and the  communication system.   A typical  EASIER  station is
%% shown in  fig.~\ref{fig:detector} (left),  the antenna is  fixed above
%% the SD and the EASIER electronics is placed in the SD electronics box.
%% The  concept described above  was implemented  in the  C-band (3.4-4.2
%% GHz)  in two different  versions, EASIER61  and GIGADuck.
\subsubsection*{EASIER61}
A first  array of  seven detectors was  installed at the  Pierre Auger
Observatory  in April  2011.  The  good operation  and results  of the
first test  bed led to an  extension of 54 more  detectors covering an
instrumented surface  of \unit[91]{$\rm km^2$}.  The  antenna used for
this setup  is a  commercial cylindrical horn  antenna with  a maximum
gain of around 9dB, it points to  the zenith and has a half power beam
width (HPBW)  of 90 degree. The  first seven LNBf are  the model GI301
made by by Global Intersat and  the 54 units of the extension are from
WSInternational, model DMX241. The sensor, composed of the antenna and
the amplification system,  are installed on top of  the SD station (cf
fig.~\ref{fig:detector} left) and the electronics box is located below
the hatch  box on top  of the SD  electronics.  The EASIER61  array is
located in  the south west part  of the Pierre  Auger Observatory, its
footprint is  shown in fig.~\ref{fig:detector} (right).   On the total
of  61   antennas,  33  have   a  North-South  polarization,   and  28
East-West.\\ Several radio events in coincidence with an extensive air
shower were measured  with EASIER61 but no conclusions  could be drawn
on the physical mechanism at the origin of the signal.

\subsubsection*{GIGADuck}
A recent calculation  of the MBR signal pointed  out that the expected
signal should  be lower by at  least two orders of  magnitude than the
first estimation presented in~\cite{Gorham}. This consideration led to
the  design  and  the  installation  in March  2015  of  GIGADuck,  an
optimized array  of seven detectors with  a higher gain  antenna and a
different  geometry.   The 15dB  gain  antenna  increases the  antenna
effective area by a factor six with respect to EASIER61.  Furthermore,
the array is now composed of a central detector pointing to the zenith
and the other surrounding six detectors points towards the central one
with a zenith angle of 20$^\circ$  as represented on the scheme of the
figure~\ref{fig:GD}.  This configuration  increases the overlap of the
detectors' field of view and enhance the possible coincident detection
in order  to disentangle between  a beamed and an  isotropic emission.
The  optimized  tilt angle  was  found  as  a compromise  between  the
coincidence  probability  and the  antenna  temperature increase  (the
brightness temperature  of the sky  increases with the  zenith angle).
To  assess  the performance  of  such  a  configuration, the  expected
maximum power detected from a vertical  10 EeV shower as a function of
the distance  for an EASIER-like  hexagon (all antennas  are vertical)
and a GIGADuck-like  one (all inclined except the  central antenna) is
shown on the figure~\ref{fig:GD} right.  While the expected amplitudes
are similar at  short distances, the effect of  inclining the antennas
is most visible at larger distances of the shower core.
 

%% With  these changes,  the  sensitivity  is
%% improved by a factor 10.  \textit{The number of expected events in one
%%   hexagon of each setup is evaluated  for a range of MBR yields on the
%%   fig.~\ref{fig:compeasiergd}.   For   a  yield  of   ??   one  expect
%%   qapproximately 2 events per year per hexagon in the case of GIGADuck
%%   whereas this number becomes negligible  in the case of an hexagon of
%%   EASIER61.}\\

%% The receiver is commercial horn antenna (fig.~\ref{fig:detector}) made
%% of a  feed and a  quarter wave length  monopole at its bottom.   It is
%% tuned  for  a  central  frequency  of  3.8  GHz  and  a  bandwidth  of
%% approximately 800GHz.  It  is associated with a low  noise block (LNB)
%% which amplifies  the signal by approximately  \unit[60]{dB} and lowers
%% down the  central frequency to  \unit[1.35]{GHz}.  
%% %% This type  of feeds
%% %% are  widely  used  for   TV  satellite  reception,  making  them  very
%% %% affordable  and  of good  quality.   The  model  GI-301SC from  Golden
%% %% Intestar was chosen for the  first phase whereas the second phase used
%% %% a  different  model   with  the  same  design,  the   ESX241  from  WS
%% %% international.  
%% A bias  tee is  inserted to provide  the power  supply to the  LNB and
%% operate   the   transmission   of   the   RF  signal   on   a   single
%% \unit[75]{$\Omega$} line.  Depending on  the setup, the line impedance
%% is adapted to \unit[50]{$\Omega$} by a resistor bridge.
%% %% inducing a loss of  \unit[5.7]{dB}. 
%% Potential low  frequency noises are filtered out  by a \unit[900]{MHz}
%% high pass filter.  A logarithmic amplifier (minicircuit AD8318) serves
%% as  a power  detector and  restitutes  a voltage  proportional to  the
%% logarithm of the RF input power.   This model was chosen for its large
%% frequency  bandwidth and  a fast  time response  of $\simeq$\unit[tens
%%   of]{ns} nominally.
%% %%   The time response
%% %% was even  lowered down to  \unit[$\sim$10]{ns} for the phase  2. 
%%  This voltage is  in turn adapted to fit into  the local station front
%%  end, originally built to accept  PMT's negative voltage between 0 and
%%  -2V.  The EASIER  final analogic signal replaces one  of the low gain
%%  channel of  the local station (each local  station acquires ordinarly
%%  the last  dynode and the  anode of three  PMTs, the anode  being used
%%  only  in  case of  saturation  of the  dynode).   The  final part  of
%%  acquisition includes an antialiasing filter cutting frequencies above
%%  \unit[20]{MHz} and the FADC digitizer sampling a \unit[19.2]{$\mu$ s}
%%  waveform at a  \unit[40]{MHz} rate and coding the  analogic signal on
%%  10 bits~\cite{augertechnical}.   The data stream is then  sent to the
%%  central acquisition and the  reconstruction of the event is performed
%%  independently of the radio signal.


%%    the The  integration to  the water  cherenkov tank
%% with the  adjusted to  level to  Auger SD array  is composed  of water
%% cherenkov  detector arranged in  tringular grid  and spaced  by 1.5km.
%% Each local station  operates three PMTs and acquires  both a high gain
%% channel (the PMT  last dynode) and a low gain  channel (the PMT anode)
%% used in case of saturation of  the former.  EASIER operates as a slave
%% detector added on the Auger local station.  Hence, EASIER is made of a
%% sensor and a processing electronics; the power supply, the acquisition
%% and the trigger being supplied  by the local station.  Since the Auger
%% array   is   totally   efficient    for   a   primary   energy   above
%% \unit[$3\cdot10^{18}$]{eV}, the  EASIER system allows us  to probe the
%% emission of EAS at UHE.\\EASIER  aims at the detection and measurement
%% of  the  electromagnetic  emission  from  the  air  shower  along  its
%% development.  For this  purpose, it is first composed  by a wide field
%% of view  antenna collecting the emitted  signal in the  C-band ([3.4 -
%%   4.2] GHz), followed by a built-in low noise amplifier.  The HF power
%% is then integrated over the full bandwidth by a logarithmic amplifier.
%% The resulting voltage, proportional to the power in dBm, is adapted to
%% fit into one  of the front end channel of the  Auger SD, replacing one
%% of the low  gain channel.  The recorded radio signal  is a waveform of
%% 1023 ADC counts  representing a dynamic range of  20dB, i.e.  a factor
%% 100 in RF power, of 19.2 $\mu$ s length sampled at 40MHz.  The time of
%% acquisition is set by the trigger supplied by the local station.
