\section{Detector calibration}
EASIER detectors  are required to measure faint  and impulsive signal.
A figure  of merit  of the  sensitivity used in  the field  is usually
given by:
\begin{equation}
\rm  F  =  \frac{k_{B}\cdot  T_{sys} }{A_{eff}\cdot  \sqrt{\Delta  \nu
    \Delta t}}
\label{eq:sensitivity}  
\end{equation}
F  represents the  flux  from a  signal  that would  equate the  noise
fluctuation.    This   equation    is   derived,   for   instance   in
\cite{otoshidanslacolle},  for  a  sensor  followed by  a  square  law
detector and  a low pass filter  of frequency $\rm  f_{cut} = 1/\Delta
t$.   \\  In  eq.~\ref{eq:sensitivity}  $\rm T_{sys}$  is  the  system
temperature, which is a measure  of the thermal noise collected by the
antenna and the electronics noise  added mainly by the first amplifier
(with $k_B$ is  the Boltzmann constant).  The square  root term is the
amount of samples  over which this noise is  averaged.  In simple case
it is the product of the  bandwidth $\Delta f$ with a time constant of
a low pass filter.  In the  case of transient signal, it is meaningful
to use the expected duration of the signal.  Finally, $\rm A_{eff}$ is
the effective  area of the antenna  i.e.  the portion  of the incoming
radio flux transformed into electrical power.
\subsection{sensor calibration}
%The   sensor,  the   antenna  and   the  LNB,   will   participate  in
%eq.~\ref{eq:sensitivity}  in   most  of   the  term.
\paragraph{antenna effective area}
The effective area is found by simulation...
%\paragraph{antenna temperature}
%The system temperature makes use of the effective area...
\paragraph{system temperature}
The system  noise temperature $\rm  T_{sys}$ is a  critical parameters
since the  sensitivity goes  linearly with  it. It is  the sum  of the
antenna noise temperature ($ \rm  T_{ant}$) and the noise added by the
electronics  stage ($ \rm  T_{elec}$) .  It is  related to  the system
power $\rm P_{sys}$ through:
\begin{equation}
  \rm  P_{sys}  =  k_{B} T_{sys}  G  \Delta  \nu  = k_{B}  (T_{ant}  +
  T_{elec}) G \Delta \nu
\end{equation}
with G the electronics gain.  Because the measurement of the gain with
a high precision is to achieve, the main method to retrieve the system
temperature  is to  combine two  measurements with  a  different input
noise power -  or the equivalent temperature - to  cancel out the gain
term.  The  system noise temperature  of EASIER and GIGAS's  LNBf were
measured by  the CROME collaboration  comparing the output  power when
the  antenna collects noise  from surrounding  material first  at room
temperature       and        then       at       liquid       nitrogen
temperature~\cite{bib:gapnoteCROME}.   The electronics  temperature of
the GI 301 was  found to be very variable from 40  to 180K, the one of
the WS  International stable  at 25K and  the Norsat at  23.5K.  MIDAS
experiment  uses  also  the  LNBf  WSI DMX241  and  measured  a  noise
temperature  of  25K~\cite{bib:midas}.   We  have  also  measured  the
electronics noise temperature of  the WSI DMX241 comparing the spectra
measured at room temperature in  laboratory when the antenna is facing
an absorber ($\rm T_{room} = \unit[300]{K}$) with the measurement when
the  antenna faces  the  sky ($T_{sky}  = \unit[7]{K}$).   \textit{The
  results   we  obtain  for   amounts  to   around  $\rm   T_{elec}  =
  \unit[40]{K}$.     The   difference   with    previously   mentioned
  measurements can  be explained  by the radome  protection.}\\One can
also use  the sun as a  calibration source since its  absolute flux is
monitored by  other radio observatory.  The increase  of power induced
upon the passage of the sun in the antenna field of view reads:
\begin{equation}
  \rm       \unit[\Delta      P]{[dBm]}       =       10      log_{10}
  (\frac{P_{sys} + P_{sun}(\theta_{sun},\phi_{sun})  }{P_{sys}} )  = 10
  log_{10}     (    1     +     \frac{    \frac{1}{2}F_{sun}     \cdot
    A_{eff}(\theta_{sun},\phi_{sun}) } {T_{sys}} )
  \label{eq:deltaP}
\end{equation}
%% \begin{equation}
%%   \rm         \unit[P_{tot}(\theta_{sun},\phi_{sun})]{[dBm]}         -
%%   \unit[P_{sys}]{[dBm]}            =            10            log_{10}
%%   (\frac{P_{sun}(\theta_{sun},\phi_{sun})  + P_{sys}}{P_{sys}} )  = 10
%%   log_{10}     (    1     +     \frac{    \frac{1}{2}F_{sun}     \cdot
%%     A_{eff}(\theta_{sun},\phi_{sun}) } {T_{sys}} )
%% \end{equation}
where    $\rm   F_{sun}$    is    the   total    solar   flux,    $\rm
A_{eff}(\theta_{sun},\phi_{sun}) $ is the antenna effective area for a
given position of the sun in  the sky and the factor $\rm \frac{1}{2}$
is  the polarization factor.   \\ This  calibration  technique is  better
suited for the GIGADuck antennas than for EASIER ones because of their
larger gain.  However, this measurement can be performed only when the
sun is  in the field  of view of  the antenna. As  it is shown  in the
figure~\ref{fig:sunsim} (left), the sun  is not visible by any antenna
of the  GIGADuck array  during austral winter  but will cross  the FOV
during summer.\\ We  retrieve the absolute value of  the daily average
sun    flux   at   \unit[2.8]{GHz}    from   public    data   released
at~\cite{sundata}.  The  flux at the  center frequency of  the C-band,
\unit[3.8]{GHz},   is  obtained   by   using  parameterization   found
in~\cite{sunparam, sunparam2}.

\end{figure}
Since  EASIER/GIGADuck is  part of  the SD  data stream  including the
monitoring system, the radio  baseline is recorded every \unit[400]{s}
with other  information such as  the outside temperature. In  order to
extract the signal from the  sun, we first remove rainy periods, since
rain and  high humidity  affect the radio  baseline in a  complex way.
Then we correct for a linear  dependence of the system's gain with the
outside temperature.  The remaining baseline shows a clear peak at the
time the  sun is expected.  It is  fitted with a Gaussian  curve and a
second order  polynomials and the height  of the Gaussian  can then be
converted into the noise temperature of the system. An example of such
a fit  is shown  in figure~\ref{fig:sunsim}. The  calibration function
given    by    the    equation    ~\ref{eq:eqcalibration}    in    the
section~\ref{sec:elec} allows us to  convert the measured variation in
ADC counts to a variation  of power.  The noise temperature is finally
deduced with equation~\ref{eq:deltaP}.  This  method is used to obtain
an insitu measurement of the  noise temperature and to monitor it with
time.  The results are given in table(results to produce)

\paragraph{sensor bandwidth}
The absolute gain  of the RF part (amplifier  combined with the losses
along  the  signal path)  does  not  enter  directly in  the  detector
sensitivity,     but    the     frequency    bandwidth     does    (cf
eq.~\ref{eq:sensitivity}).  The  normalized gain  of the LNB  used for
EASIER61 (GI301, DMX241) and GIGADuck (Norsat 8115) are represented in
the  fig.~\ref{fig:normalizedgain}  and  the  effective  bandwidth  is
computed according:
\begin{equation}
  \rm \Delta \nu = \frac{1}{G_{max}} \int G(f) \cdot df
\end{equation}
We  obtain effective bandwidths  of \unit[437  $\rm \pm$  30]{MHz} and
\unit[445 $\rm \pm$ 56]{MHz} for the GI301 and the DMX241 respectively
and \unit[750]{MHz} for the Norsat.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Adaptation electronics calibration}
\label{sec:elec}
\subsubsection{Specification}
The adaptation electronics starts with the power detector and ends the
analog to digital converter of the Auger SD.  The power detector is an
Analog Device AD8318 (in the encapsuled version Minicircuits ZX47-50),
it is  a logarithmic  amplifier with a  wide bandwith and  large power
dynamic  range.   The  output  voltage  is  filtered  with  an  output
capacitor for the first seven detectors, but the capacitor was removed
for  the  flollowing  version   EASIER61  and  GIGADuck.  The  initial
conversion factor of the power detector is:
\begin{equation}
  \rm  A [V] =  -0.0234\cdot P [dBm] + offset
\label{eq:eqpd}
\end{equation}
 The  power detector  voltage is  then amplified  by a  factor  4.2 to
 obtain  a final  power dynamics  of \unit[20]{dB}  over the  1024 ADC
 counts of the  SD acquisition. The overall conversion  from the input
 power to the ADC is:
\begin{equation}
  \rm ADC = 50.2\cdot P [dBm] + offset
\label{eq:eqcalibration}
\end{equation}
The offset is designed to be adjustable to make up for the differences
of the detectors gain.

\subsubsection{Frequency response and electronics simulation}
In  the  following  paragraphs  we  study the  time  response  of  the
adaptation  electronics. 
\paragraph{power detector calibration}
To understand better  the power detector, we set  a detection chain in
laboratory composed  of a C-band LNB  followed by a  power detector. A
fast oscilloscope is  used to record simultaneously the  LNB and power
detector's  output. We  used the  spark  of an  electronic lighter  to
produce broadband  signal and emulate  the signal from an  air shower.
With these calibration data we  find that the power detector output is
well reproduced when one perform  a convolution of the input signal in
dBm (logarithmic unit) with an exponential function:
\begin{equation}
  \rm V_{PD}(t) = k_{1}\cdot \int_{t>0}P_{dBm}(u)exp(\frac{t-u}{\tau})du + k_{2}
  \label{eq:convolution}
\end{equation}
We   fix    $\rm   k_{1}$   to   the   conversion    factor   of   the
equation~\ref{eq:eqpd}  and  we  find  $\rm \tau$  by  minimizing  the
distance $\rm d = \Sigma (V_{measured} - V_{simulated})^2$ between the
two  waveforms.  An  example  of the  recorded  data is  shown in  the
fig.~\ref{fig:powerdetsim}  in   blue  and  the   resulting  simulated
waveform is shown  in red.  We find an integration  time $\rm \tau$ of
$\rm \tau_{capa}  = \unit[41.5]{ns}$ when an  output capacitor follows
the power detector and $\rm \tau_{nocapa} = \unit[6.3]{ns}$ without.

 \caption{Example  of RF  and power  detector waveforms.  The measured
   waveforms are in blue and the simulated one in red. The lower panel
   show the difference.}
 \label{fig:powerdetsim}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{EASIER board}
The response of  the EASIER board is found with  the same technique as
in the  previous paragraph.  We  recorded simultaneously the  input of
the  board and  its  output. Here,  we  find the  board's response  by
measuring the its transfer function in the frequency domain:
\begin{equation}
  \rm \tilde{H}(f) = \frac{\tilde{V}_{out}(f)}{\tilde{V}_{in}(f)}
\end{equation}
The  gain  $|H(f)|$   is  represented  in  the  figure~\ref{fig:board}
together with  a gaussian fit used  to simulate the  board. \\The last
part of  the chain, the Auger front  end is simulated with  a low pass
filter with $\rm f_{cut} = \unit[20]{MHz}$ and by sampling in time and
amplitude.
\begin{figure}[!ht]

 \subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{fitphaseboard.png}}
 \caption{}
 \label{fig:board}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{validation with data}
In order to  validate the calibration and simulation,  we compare them
with the  actual radio waveform  we record in  the Auger data.   An RF
waveform   is  generated   from   the  spectra   represented  in   the
figure~\ref{fig:normalizedgain}   by  inverse  FFT.    The  adaptation
electronics simulation  is then applied to  it in order  to produce an
trace    in   ADC    count.     We   can    now    compare   in    the
figure~\ref{fig:distcomparison} the distribution  of the noise for the
data (in grey)  and the simulation (in red).  The comparison are shown
for the three setups.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
 \centering
 \hspace*{-3ex}

 \subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.32\linewidth]{m3_distdatasimGD.png}}
 \caption{}
 \label{fig:distcomparison}
\end{figure}
If the simulations agree very well for EASIER61 and GIGADuck, it tends
to overestimate the noise fluctuation for the first setup. However the
measured and simulated standard  deviation of the distributions differ
 at maximum by 15 ADC counts which represent \unit[0.3]{dB} or 7\%.

%% The  sensitivity of  a radio  detector can  be defined  with  two main
%% quantities:  the   antenna  effective   area  and  the   system  noise
%% temperature.   The effective  area  measures the  portion of  incoming
%% electro magnetic flux actually collected by the antenna, it is related
%% to  the gain  of the  antenna  and depends  on the  frequency and  the
%% observation angle.  The  system noise temperature is a  measure of all
%% the  contributions  of noise,  including  the  antenna  noise and  the
%% amplification noise. The time averaged power received is:
%% \begin{equation}
%%   P_{N}  = k_{B}T_{sys}\Delta \nu G_{sys}
%% \end{equation}
%% where k$_{B}$  is the Boltzmann  constant, $\Delta \nu$  the frequency
%% bandwidth  and $G_{sys}$  the system  gain (antenna  and amplification
%% chain).  Furthermore,  for a square  law detector like EASIER  we have
%% the  following  relation  between  the  average power  and  the  noise
%% distribution:
%% \begin{equation}
%%   \sigma_{N} = \frac{P_{N}}{\sqrt{\Delta \nu\cdot \Delta t}}
%% \end{equation} 
%% $\Delta t$ is the integration time $\tau$ of the system for signals of
%% the order or  shorter than $\tau$, it can be taken  as the duration of
%% the  expected signal otherwise.   \\One can  then compute  the minimum
%% flux to obtain a signal equal to the noise fluctuations with:
%% \begin{equation}
%% \rm F  = \frac{k_{B}\cdot T_{sys}  }{A_{eff}\cdot \sqrt{\Delta  \nu \Delta
%%     t}}
%% \label{eq:sensitivity}
%% \end{equation}

%% \subsection{Antenna effective area and temperature}
%% A horn type of antenna was chosen  for their large field of view and a
%% flat gain in frequency. The  full simulation of the horn including the
%% protecting  radome was carried  out with  HFSS software  and confirmed
%% these          characteristics           as          shown          in
%% fig.~\ref{fig:aeff}(left)(\textcolor{red}{find  a  better picture  and
%%   simulated gain  plot}).  In addition,  the gain of one  horn antenna
%% (ESX241)  was   measured  in  anechoic  chamber   at  IMEP  laboratory
%% (Grenoble) at frequencies from \unit[3.4 to 4.2]{GHz}.  The beam width
%% at \unit[-3]{dB} is around  \unit[45]{$^{\circ}$} and the average gain
%% at boresight is  found to be \unit[8.75]{dBi}. The  backlobe gain were
%% found to be lower than the maximum gain by \unit[20]{dB}.  The angular
%% effective area is  derived from the equation $A_{eff}  = \frac{G \cdot
%%   c^{2}}{4\pi \nu^{2}}$ and  shown in fig.~\ref{fig:aeff}(right) is of
%% the order  of \unit[3.5$\cdot 10^{-3}$]{$m^{2}$} at the  middle of the
%% band.

%% \subsection{System gain}

%% \subsection{Noise temperature}
%% \paragraph{Antenna noise temperature} 
%% The thermal noise collected by the antenna is estimated by integration
%% of  the brightness  temperature profile  over the  whole  solid angle,
%% weighted by the antenna gain.
%% \begin{equation}
%%   T_{ant} = \frac{1}{4\pi \Delta\nu}\int_{3.8 GHz}^{4.2 GHz}\int_{4\pi} T_{B}(\Omega)A_{eff}(\Omega,\nu)d\nu d\Omega
%% \end{equation}
%%  The     brightness    temperature    is     of    the     order    of
%%  \unit[4]{K}  for  angle  where the  antenna
%%  gain is maximum (towards the  sky) and is the physical temperature of
%%  the ground,  $\simeq$ \unit[300]{K}, where the gain  is minimum.  The
%%  temperature     profile    at     \unit[2.295]{GHz}     taken    from
%%  \cite{otoshidanslacolle} is used and yields an antenna temperature of
%%  \unit[7.5]{K}.
%% \begin{figure}[!t]

%%   \subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.55\linewidth]{aeff.pdf}}  
%%   \caption{Left: Antenna CAD model and resulting gain.  Right:Measured
%%     effective area, between 3.4 and 4.2 GHz.}
%%   \label{fig:aeff}  
%% \end{figure}

%% \paragraph{amplification temperature}
%% The RF electronics line composed by the LNB, the impedance adapter and
%% the cable is taken as a whole.   Note that given the very high gain of
%% the first stage  of amplification, the noise induced  of the following
%% device  will  be negligible.   The  gain  ($G_{elec}$)  and the  noise
%% temperature  ($T_{elec}$) are  calculated  by the  so called  hot/cold
%% method.  In this  calibration  technique the  RF  system is  subjected
%% alternatively to high and  low power (or temperature). The temperature
%% of the device under test is simply expressed as:
%% \begin{equation}
%%   T_{DUT} = \frac{T_{hot} - Y\cdot T_{cold}}{Y-1}
%% \end{equation}
%% with  $\rm   Y  $  the  ratio   of  the  measured  power:   $\rm  Y  =
%% P_{hot}/P_{cold}$.\\ This method was applied to power spectra taken at
%% room  temperature, i.e.  with  a uniform  antenna temperature  of $\rm
%% \unit[T_{hot} = 300]{K}$, compared  to spectrum measured on site, i.e.
%% at $\rm  \unit[T_{cold} =  7.5]{K}$. The measurement  was made  for 28
%% systems of the  second setup, the temperature ranges  from \unit[19 to
%%   29]{K}.\\The  temperature  parameter  is  crucial and  difficult  to
%% measure because  of the  high gain of  the amplifier. The  other group
%% already  mentionned (AMBER,  CROME  and MIDAS)  used  similar type  of
%% antenna  and  measured  as  well  their  noise  temperature.   With  a
%% dedicated   cryogenic  setup\cite{crome},   the   CROME  collaboration
%% measured the  noise temperature of  LNBF GI301SC and ESX241.   For the
%% LNBF GI301SC,  the temperature measured  was really unstable  and they
%% found a mean  temperature of 91K but ranging from  40K to 180K. ESX241
%% LNBF were  more stable and a  LNB temperature of around  25K was found
%% and is compatible with the 23K found with room/sky spectrum comparison
%% presented before.  An absolute calibration of the LNBF ESX241 was also
%% performed  by the  MIDAS  collaboration measuring  the  sun flux,  and
%% yielded a temperature of  \unit[20]{K}.\\ In the following, the system
%% temperature  is   assumed  different  for   the  two  setups:   $  \rm
%% \unit[T_{sys1} =  30]{K}$ and $  \rm \unit[T_{sys2} =  187]{K}$. 

%% These
%% number  are realistic  for the  first  one, and  conservative for  the
%% second.

%% \subsection{Detector sensitivity}
%% The microwave power signal $P_{EAS}$ expected for an incoming flux $F$
%% from   the  EAS   is \begin{equation}  P_{EAS}   =  F_{EAS}\cdot
%%   A_{eff}(\theta,\phi)\cdot G_{elec}\cdot \Delta \nu
%% \end{equation}
%% where  $G_{elec}$  denotes for  the  electronics  gain, $A_{eff}$  the
%% effective  area  of  the  antenna  and  $\Delta  \nu$  the  bandwidth.
%% \textcolor{red}{here  in  principle  we  have to  integrate  over  the
%%   frequency because the effective area depends on the frequency (in my
%%   thesis,  it was  done with  the middle  frequency  (3.8GHz)).} \\The
%% power  of  noise is  usually  expressed  thanks  to the  system  noise
%% temperature,  these  two quantities  are  related  with the  Boltzmann
%% constant  and the electronics  gain via:  $P_{N} =  k_{B}\cdot T_{sys}
%% \cdot  G_{elec} \cdot  \Delta  \nu$.   In the  C-band  the only  noise
%% contributions come from the thermal radiation collected by the antenna
%% from  the surrounding  material ($T_{ant}$)  and the  electronic noise
%% from the amplification ($T_{elec}$).   Moreover, in the case of EASIER
%% and  more generally  for a  gaussian noise  measured by  a  square law
%% detectors, the standard deviation of  the power is related to its mean
%% via:
%% \begin{equation}
%%   \sigma_{N} = \frac{P_{N}}{\sqrt{\Delta \nu \Delta t}}
%% \end{equation}
%% where $\Delta  \nu$ is the bandwidth  and $\Delta t$ the  time on which
%% the signal  can be integrated.\\Hence, a  figure of merit  is given by
%% the flux inducing a power equal to the noise standard deviation:
%% \begin{equation}
%%   \frac{P_{EAS}}{\sigma_{N}} = 1 \rightarrow F = \frac{k_{B}\cdot T_{sys} }{A_{eff}\cdot \sqrt{\Delta \nu \Delta t}}
%% \end{equation}
%% The minimal detectable flux for is 

%% \subsection{Adatation electronics calibration}
%% The role of the EASIER electronics  is to convert the RF signal into a
%% signal adapted to  the Auger SD front end  Analog to Digital Converter
%% (ADC).  %% It is performed firstly  by a wide band logarithmic amplifier,
%% %% the  power  detector Minicircuit  AD8318.   The  output  of the  power
%% %% detector is a voltage proportional to  the input RF power in dBm ($\rm
%% %% 0dBm = 10log_{10}(\frac{P}{1mW}) $).  This output is then amplified in
%% %% order to fi
%% \paragraph{calibration}
%% The RF  power is integrated  by the logarithmic  amplifier minicircuit
%% AD8318. It is a cascade amplifier outputing a voltage proportional the
%% logarithm of the input RF  power.  It is associated with an adaptation
%% board  which scales the  voltage to  obtain a  final dynamic  range of
%% \unit[20]{dB}.  An offset voltage can  be adjusted to set the baseline
%% at the desired  level.  Each electronic unit was  calibrated prior its
%% installation in laboratory  and the offset was ajusted  on site during
%% the installation.  The average conversion factor from the power in dBm
%% to the output voltage is  \unit[0.1]{V/dB} and is very stable from one
%% unit to another (cf fig.~\ref{fig:calibadaptationelectronics}).

%% \end{equation}
%% \paragraph{study of the impulse response}
%% The detector  was studied  with continuous sine  wave in  the previous
%% paragraph.   We  complete  this  calibration  with the  study  of  the
%% response of  the adaptation electronics to short  impulses (ns scale).
%% The  detection system  (antenna-RF line-power  detector) was  setup in
%% laboratory, and  short broadband  radio impulses were  generated using
%% the  spark  of  an   electronic  lighter.   The  signal  was  recorded
%% simultaneously after the LNB and  after the power detector with a fast
%% oscilloscope (5GS/s).  It was found that the power detector signal is
%% well reproduced  by the  convolution of the  RF power waveform  in dBm
%% with an exponential decay function:
%% \begin{equation}
%%   V_{PD}(t) = k_{1}\cdot \int_{t>0}P_{dBm}(u)exp(\frac{t-u}{\tau})du + k_{2}
%% \end{equation}
%% where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are simple linear scaling and $\tau$ is the time
%% response  of  the power  detector.   The  agreement  between data  and
%% electronics        simulation       can        be        seen       in
%% fig.~\ref{fig:powerdetectorresponse}  and  is found  to  be less  than
%% \unit[1]{dB}  (30\%)  even on  very  short  signals  of the  order  of
%% \unit[10]{ns}.

%% \subsection{Flux estimation} 
%% The  flux of  an incoming  signal can  be estimated  only  knowing the
%% $T_{sys}$  and   $A_{eff}$.   If  one  express   the  measured  signal
%% subtracted by  the its average  and divided by the  noise fluctuation,
%% one obtain:
%% \begin{equation}
%%   p_{rel} = \frac{P_{tot}(t) - P_{N}}{\sigma_{N}} = \frac{F_{EAS}\cdot
%%     A_{eff}(\theta, \phi)\cdot \Delta \nu \cdot G_{sys}}{\sigma_{N}}
%%   \label{eq:prel}
%% \end{equation}
%% or:
%% \begin{equation}
%%   F_{EAS}        =        \frac{p_{rel}\cdot        k_{B}        \cdot
%%     T_{sys}}{A_{eff}\sqrt{\Delta \nu\cdot \Delta t}}
%% \end{equation}
